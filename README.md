# 06_WeatherDashboard
Build a page that will allow users to search for a city and then display the current and forecasted weather for the selected cities utilizing the openweathermap.org api.

DESCRIPTION
The goal of this project was to create a webpage where a user can enter different cities and see the current weather as well as a five day forecast. 

I utilize the cityName variable to customize the api request URL's

INSTALLATION
Open the webpage and then use the text entry field on the left to search for cities and see their weather.

USAGE
When you open the index.html file, a small webpage should look similar to this screenshot: <img width="1110" alt="HW06_WeatherSearch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75180482/107162116-4f1bdb00-695e-11eb-8bd8-8e2fd539f591.png">
